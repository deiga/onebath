        One Bath is a week-long celebration of diversity on campus, starting on Sunday 3rd March and ending on Saturday 9th. The aim of the week is to demonstrate the huge cultural diversity in the University (more than 30% of Bath students are international students), and to promote inclusiveness and a sense of unity. Ultimately, the goal is to have fun. Therefore, we are cooperating with many groups and societies on campus and within the local community to deliver a diverse and interesting programme. Each day of the week has a specific theme (e.g. sports, performances, food tasting, community, faith and cultural, and equality), and most days end with a film night or a cultural performance. The food venues on campus will be doing deals on international meals and will provide drinks from around the world – so look out for those! Fuzzy Ducks will round off the whole event with an international themed night on the Saturday.
